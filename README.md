=======================================

            

Add-AzureRmAnalysisServicesFirewallRule is a small powershell script that uses the the Set-AzureRmResource cmdlet to dd firewall rules to an Azure Analysis Service instance.


Once you run it, the script will ask you for:


  *  The resource group name where the Analysis Service is deployed 
  *  The name of the Azure Analysis Service instance. 
  *  The firewall rule name 
  *  The starting ip 
  *  The end ip 

 

 

        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
